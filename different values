Write a program to print only the different values between two given sets.
Sample Input:
1 2 3 4
2 4 6 8
Sample Output:
1 3
Note: There are trailing spaces at the end of output.


answer:
def print_difference_between_sets():
    set1 = set(map(int, input("5 ").split()))
    set2 = set(map(int, input("5").split()))
    
    # Find the difference between sets
    difference = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
    
    # Print the result with trailing spaces
    for value in sorted(difference):
        print(value, end=" ")
    print()  # This ensures a new line at the end

print_difference_between_sets()

output:
5  2
5 3
2 3
